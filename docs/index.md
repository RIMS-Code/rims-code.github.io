# Welcome to the RIMS-Code website

Here you find an assortment of resources and tools

and resonance ionization mass spectrometry.
Below is a list of some resources 
that you can find on this page:

- [Form to submit a new scheme for the database](submit_scheme.md)
- [Help on how to submit a new scheme](contribute.md#contribute-to-the-website)
- [Crystal angle calculator for second and third harmonic generation](crystal-calculator.md)

This website is a community-driven effort, 
and we welcome any contributions!
